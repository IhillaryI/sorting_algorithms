# Sorting Algorithms
This repo is a project based repo, that shows knowledged gained from working on tasks and learning from learning resources.
This is in fulfillment of the Alx General requirements.
Below is a list of files in this repository

---
- **0-bubble_sort.c**: a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm
- **0-O**: contains the worst case, average case and best case time complexity of the bubble_sort algorithm
- **1-O**: contains the best case, average case and worst case of the insertion_sort algorithm
- **1-insertion_sort_list.c**: function that sorts a doubly linked list in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm
- **2-O**: constains the best case, average case and worst case time complexity of the selection sort algorithm
- **2-selection_sort.c**: a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Selection sort algorithm
- **3-O**: contains the best case, average case and worst case time complexity of the quick_sort algorithm
- **3-quick_sort.c**: a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the quick sort algorithm
main.c
- **sort.h**: the repository header file. contains all function prototypes.
